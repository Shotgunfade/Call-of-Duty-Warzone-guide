    <h1>what is plunder in Warzone?</h1>
    <img src="k.jfif"/>
    <h2>Plunder mode is a version of the Battle Royale mode that tasks your team with gathering as much in-game cash as possible, rather than simply surviving to the end.

When you die you'll respawn, rather than going to the Gulag or being eliminated altogether, and there's no closing circle of gas that changes the play area. You have the whole map to work with.

<br>HOW TO WIN IN PLUNDER<br>
To win a game of Plunder, you need to come out victorious at the end of the Bonus Round period. This is activated when any team collects a total of $1million, held or deposited, which you can see in-game in the tracker in the bottom right of your screen.

When the Bonus Round starts, you have until the timer reaches zero to place yourselves above that team, either by reducing the amount of cash they have (by killing them) or by earning even more yourselves. Whichever team has the most cash at the end of the Bonus Round wins.

<BR>WHERE DO YOU FIND CASH IN PLUNDER?<BR> Warzone explained
There are a number of ways you can find cash in Plunder mode for Call of Duty: Warzone.

The main way is by finding cash either in the Supply Boxes scattered across the Warzone map. To do this simply explore the map and keep your ears open for the low hum that signifies your near a Supply Box.

You might also find piles of cash hidden away in various buildings using this method.

Completing contracts - the in-game mini-missions you can collect from the yellow-gold glowing items in-game - will also reward you with a substantial cash prize, which goes towards your total.

Killing other players, however, is the way you can truly earn a lot of cash.

Whenever you kill another player, they will drop any and all of the cash they were holding. This means that you can easily collect a lot of cash very quickly if you and your squad are skilled enough.

The three players carrying the most amount of cash will also become visible on your Tac map; the second and third will be symbolised by a red bag of money, while the player with the highest amount of money will be marked with a red crown.

Simply open up your Tac map and you'll be given an idea about where these three players are.

Hunting down and killing one of these players could be the action that wins you the Plunder match. It's also, however, a very dangerous tactic, because not only will the players you're hunting be quite skilled, but other squads will be using the same tactics.

Finally, the most amount of cash can be earned from taking down Attack Helicopters - the black helicopters that appear in the sky during the Bonus Round - which will grant you massive sums of money, but comes at a huge risk, of course, that the choppers could take you out first. Plus, they're only available in that Bonus Round - so they're not something to rely on!<h2>
