	<h2>Call of Duty Warzone takes plenty of Blackout’s DNA, but is keen to tweak the recipe with new systems like health regeneration,
		a Gunfight-inspired respawn system, and Buy Stations, which let you add killstreaks to your loadout. Playing in your trio
		you’ll need to collect cash by looting, eliminating other players, and completing Warzone contracts, which you can then
		spend on killstreaks and upgrades at Buy Stations. Warzone Buy Stations are located at all points of interest marked on
		your map, so you will never be too far away from one. To use it, you just run up to one and interact with it, this will
		open up the buy menu, where you can choose from nine upgrades and killstreaks. Prices range from $1500 to $6000 with the
		lowest upgrade netting you a bundle of armor plates, and the most expensive upgrade granting you a loadout drop marker,
		which is a way of getting one of your favourite Modern Warfare classes in Warzone. Buy Stations are also essential if you
		want to bring back downed comrades as you can buy Redeploy Tokens at these in order to give your, er, less-skilled friends
		another chance on the battlefield. In order to get you caught up on the new mechanic and we’ve collected together everything
		you need to know about Warzone Buy Stations. <br>WHERE CAN YOU FIND WARZONE BUY STATIONS?<br> Buy Stations are denoted on the in-game
		map by the shopping cart icon. Generally, there’s one in every point of interest, so expect to have to fight off another
		trio for the right to use one uninterrupted. Major POIs appear to have several Buy Stations, so you should be able to resupply
		even during large-scale firefights. They can also spawn in different locations ever match, so don’t dive in thinking your
		favourite spot will always have one.<br> WHAT CAN YOU PURCHASE AT BUY STATIONS IN WARZONE?<br> Here’s the breakdown of prices,
		killstreaks, and upgrades that can be bought at CoD Buy Sations: <br>Armor Plate Bundle – $1,500<br> Shield Turret – $2,000<br> Cluster
		Strike – $3,000<br> Gas Mask – $3,000<br> Precision Airstrike – $3,500<br> UAV – $4,000 <br> Self-Revive Kit – $4,500<br> Squad Buyback – $4,500 <br>
		per teammate Munitions Box – $5,000 <br> Loadout Drop Marker – $10,000<br> Please note that you can only carry one killstreak per
		player, so while you can technically go into the final zone with three Cluster Strikes among your team, you’ll likely only
		see a little bit of killstreak-hoarding as players will need to spend on other upgrades over the course of a match. Cash
		piles appear to drop in tidy $100 stacks, where a small cash spawn might be $500, just to give you a reference for how
		fast you can go from broke to buying killstreaks. And there you have it,
