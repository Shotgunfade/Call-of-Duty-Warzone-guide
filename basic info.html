    <h2>Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. The game is a part of the 2019 title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare but does not require purchase of it. Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software and published by Activision. Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players set in the fictional city of Verdansk, which is loosely based on Donetsk city in Eastern Ukraine, on day 96 of Operation: Rapid Sunder. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between both games.

The game features two main modes: and Battle Royale. Warzone introduces a new in-game currency system called Cash which is used at Buy Stations in and around Verdansk. Loadout drops are an example of where Cash can be traded for limited access to players' custom classes (which are shared with Modern Warfare's standard modes). Players may also use Cash to purchase items such as killstreaks and gas masks. At launch, Warzone allowed a squad capacity of three. A solo mode was added to Warzone a week later on March 17, 2020. Four player Quads were added to the game on April 8, 2020 as part of the Season 3 update. <h2>
