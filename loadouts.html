    <h1>what are loadouts in warzone?<h1>

      <h2>Loadouts are something that many veteran Call of Duty players will be used to. In normal multiplayer, they determine your equipment, and you can have multiple custom loadouts to allow you to choose whatever suits the level. In Warzone though, they're a little different.

With it being a battle royale mode, you don't get to start off with these loadouts though. Instead, you need to hunt around for cash first, once you've got a cool $10,000 on you, head to a Buy Station. After you've purchased the Loadout Drop Marker, you just have to find a quiet place to put it. Once it lands, you'll be able to choose which of your loadouts you want.

Just remember to set them up beforehand in the multiplayer menus for the best results, otherwise you'll only be able to choose from the default presets.<h2>
